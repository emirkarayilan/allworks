Escape from the Maze – Turn-Based Simulation Game Using Classical Data Structures
This project is a turn-based multi-agent maze escape simulation developed as part of the CENG 202 Data Structures course at İzmir Katip Çelebi University. The simulation is built using fundamental data structures such as stacks, queues, singly linked lists, and circular linked lists—without relying on built-in collections.

Each agent navigates a randomly generated maze filled with walls, traps, power-ups, and rotating corridors. The game features stack-based movement history, queue-based turn scheduling, and circular corridor mechanics. The goal is for agents to reach the exit while tracking various performance metrics like backtracking steps, power-ups used, and total turns taken.

The system is fully modular, object-oriented, and outputs detailed logs of the simulation process.
